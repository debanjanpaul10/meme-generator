# Random-Meme-Generator
A simple Meme Generator made using React JS from scratch

### Features of the App âž¢
ðŸ‘‰  Made with the help of Facebook's React JavaScript Library

ðŸ‘‰  Contains the imgflip API in the heart of the program that randomly renders memes into the page

ðŸ‘‰  The app contains two input boxes one for the top text and one for the bottom text

ðŸ‘‰  The top text input field dynamically renders text to the top of the image generated as the user types into the boxes. Same goes for the bottom text

ðŸ‘‰  The Gen button automatically renders another random meme image from the imgflip API and embeds the top and bottom texts on the image.

ðŸ‘‰  Is a fun app that works on any device with npm on it.
